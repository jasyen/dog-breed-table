A website that allows users to move and change the order of dog breeds between two tables.

The user may then export the tables to a json.

The data is fetched from https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all.

Created using Typescript, React, and Redux.

Drag and drop functionality was implemented without the use of packages such as react-dnd.
